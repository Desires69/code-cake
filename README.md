# Code Cake

A delicious, curated concoction of resources and tools for full stack
software engineers who are looking to master modern web and app
development.

**Note:** While the purpose of this repo is to be a comprehensive list, full
stack developers are not expected to be human encyclopedias. They are, however,
expected to be curious, passionate, and driven.

Get your hands dirty in the entire development process — from design to
deployment — so that you're able to intelligently communicate with everyone
on the team. Along the way, specialize in a few choice technologies.

**Bonus:** A startup section is included for the many software engineers who
are using their skills to build their own companies and/or work their way up
to become CTO.
