# Full Stack Prep

Resources and interview questions for full stack software engineers who are
looking to master modern web and app development.

**Note:** While the purpose of this repo is to be a comprehensive list, full
stack developers are not expected to be human encyclopedias. They are, however,
expected to be curious, passionate, and driven.

Get your hands dirty in the entire development process — from design to
deployment — so that you're able to intelligently communicate with everyone
on the team. And specialize in a few choice technologies.
