# Code Cake

A delicious concoction of resources, tools, and interview questions for full
stack software engineers who are looking to master modern web and app
development.

**Note:** While the purpose of this repo is to be a comprehensive list, full
stack developers are not expected to be human encyclopedias. They are, however,
expected to be curious, passionate, and driven.

Get your hands dirty in the entire development process — from design to
deployment — so that you're able to intelligently communicate with everyone
on the team. Along the way, specialize in a few choice technologies.
